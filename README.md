# SCTree-test
SCTree test is an algorithm that can statistical detect the hidden structure of high-dimensional single-cell dataset, which the intrinsic structure may be linear structure of branched structure. Based on the tools of spiked matrix model and random matrix theory, SCTree construct the discordance matrix by transforming the distance between any pair of cells used Gromov-Farris transform. Then the discordance matrix can be formulated as the spiked matrix model. Therefore, we detect the spiked matrix model of discordance matrix whether signal or not. SCTree test have successfully identify the branch event of real RNA-seq data, meanwhile, by combining with the reconstruct method (such as Wishbone), it also can identify the multiple bifurcations of cellular process.
